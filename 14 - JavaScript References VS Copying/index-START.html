    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array

    const ogPlayers = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const newPlayers = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    console.log(ogPlayers)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const team = ogPlayers

    console.log(team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    team[3] = 'Dave'

    // now here is the problem!

    console.log(ogPlayers)
    console.log(team)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = [...newPlayers]

    console.log(newPlayers)
    console.log(team2)

    const team3 = Array.from(newPlayers)

    console.log(team3)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team2[3] = 'Pete'
    team3[3] = 'Sven'

    console.log(newPlayers)
    console.log(team2)
    console.log(team3)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const copiedPerson = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Thomas', age: '50', alias: 'The Tank' })

    console.log(person)
    console.log(copiedPerson)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
